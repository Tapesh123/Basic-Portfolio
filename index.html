            I possess an extremely diligent and self-driven work ethic and strong critical thinking capabilities. I have the ability
            to communicate and collaborate effectively and respectfully with colleagues and staff to build strong working relationships
            while delivering strong analytical and problem solving skills. </p>
            
            <p>For fun activites, I love to spend time with my wife, read new articles and learn to code! Coding has become a great interest
                for me and with enough experience and practice I would love to work in the industry.</p>

            <p>In terms of sports, I love to go snowboarding during the winter times, preferably snowboard in Vermont where the snow is
                soft! During spring and summer months I love to go swimming and play basketball.</p>
